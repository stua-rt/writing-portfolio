These are some links to pages from the Netwrix documentation site that I contributed to during my time at Netwrix. I am providing these to demonstrate some of the different types of documentation I worked on in my previous role.

## New Reporting Wizards
I created these topics to document new wizards that were added to Netwrix Access Analyzer:

- [Report Configuration Wizard](https://docs.netwrix.com/docs/accessanalyzer/12_0/admin/report/wizard/overview) *(including sub-topics)*

- [Chart Configuration Wizard](https://docs.netwrix.com/docs/accessanalyzer/12_0/admin/report/chartwizard/overview) *(including sub-topics)*

- [Report Cleanup when Deleting a Job or Job Group](https://docs.netwrix.com/docs/accessanalyzer/12_0/admin/report/cleanup)

## Microsoft Entra ID Configuration
I wrote instructions for integrating the product with Microsoft Entra ID. The first topic enables access to scan Microsoft Entra Roles information, and the second provides steps to integrate Microsoft Entra ID SSO. 

- [Entra Roles](https://docs.netwrix.com/docs/accessanalyzer/12_0/requirements/entraid/entraid/entraroles)

- [Microsoft Entra ID Single Sign-On](https://docs.netwrix.com/docs/accessanalyzer/12_0/install/application/reports/entraidsso)

## Certificate Configuration
I created this topic with steps for configuring security certificates using a command line tool: 

- [FSAA Manual Certificate Configuration](https://docs.netwrix.com/docs/accessanalyzer/12_0/admin/datacollector/fsaa/certificatemanagement/manualcertificate)

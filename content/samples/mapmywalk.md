## During Workout
During the workout, as you walk your movement is tracked on the map. You can also see the time elapsed and your distance travelled at the bottom of the screen. To see more live stats, such as calories and pace, tap the grey bar on the bottom panel. You can then return to the map view by tapping the same bar again.

If you want to take a break, then you have the option to pause the workout. This temporarily stops the clock, so that the break period does not affect your workout stats. To pause the workout, tap the **PAUSE** button at the bottom of the screen. To then resume your workout, tap **RESUME**. 

Along the walk you can also take photos from within the app and have them automatically saved in your workout. To do this, tap the camera button at the top right of the screen, take a photo, and then tap **OK**. 

{{< note >}}
The first time you use the camera feature, you need to give the app the relevant permission to use your phone’s camera. When prompted, accept the access request.

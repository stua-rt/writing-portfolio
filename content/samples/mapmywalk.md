This is a sample piece of writing I created. My task was to produce a quick start guide for an app that I was already familiar with. I choose to write about MapMyWalk, which gave me the added benefit of going for a nice walk to capture screenshots and verify my instructions!

# MapMyWalk Quick Start Guide
MapMyWalk is an app that tracks your route as you walk and provides helpful statistics. You can then save your results to view later and share with others.

This guide helps you to set up the MapMyWalk app and use it on your first walk.

- [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/map-my-walk-by-under-armour/id307861492)

## Start Your Workout
When you are ready to start walking, you need to start a workout in the app. To do this, open the app to the home screen, and then tap **START WORKOUT**. Your workout begins, and you can start walking.

Before starting a workout, you can optionally customise the workout settings. This includes configuring voice feedback or setting a delayed start timer. To access the Workout Setup screen, tap the settings icon at the top right of the home screen.

## During the Workout
As you walk, your route is tracked on the map. You can also see the time elapsed and your distance travelled at the bottom of the screen. To view more live statistics, such as calories burned and pace, tap the grey bar on the bottom panel. To return to the map view, tap the same bar again.

If you want to take a break, you can pause the workout. This temporarily stops the timer so the break does not affect your workout statistics. To pause the workout, tap **PAUSE** at the bottom of the screen. When you are ready to continue, tap **RESUME**. 

During your walk, you can also take photos from within the app and have them automatically saved in your workout. To do this, tap the camera button at the top right of the screen, take a photo, and tap **OK**. 

{{< note >}}
The first time you use the camera feature, you need to give the app the relevant permission to use your device’s camera. When prompted, accept the request for permission.

1. On the Save Workout screen, do the following:
    - Edit the workout name.
    - Add any notes you want to record about the walk.
    - Add or remove photos as desired.
    - Select the **Visible To** setting as either **Private**, **Friends**, or **Public**.

Your workout results are now saved.

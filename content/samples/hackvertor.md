# Hackvertor
Hackvertor is a tag-based conversion tool that you can add as an extension to Burp Suite. It supports various encodings including HTML5 entities, hex, and URL encoding.  

When you encode with Hackvertor, it inserts tags around the text and then automatically does the conversion when you send the request. This allows you to continue working with a payload in its unencoded form, which means itâ€™s easier to read and removes any need for you to manually decode and re-encode the payload each time you modify it. 

## Installing Hackvertor
You can add Hackvertor to Burp Suite via the BApp Store. To install Hackvertor:
1.	Go to Extensions > BApp Store.
1.	Select Hackvertor from the list of extensions. You can use the search bar to easily find it.
1.	Click Install.  

## Using Hackvertor to encode an SQL injection payload
This tutorial shows you how you can use Hackvertor to encode a payload. You are going to use this payload to test the vulnerability of a fake shopping website to SQL injection.

### Step one: Access the website
First you must open the target website and perform an action on it.
1.	Go to Proxy > Intercept and click Open browser.
1.	In the browser, go to the following URL: `https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/examining-the-database/lab-listing-database-contents-non-oracle`
1.	Click Access the lab. 
1.	If prompted, log in with your credentials.
1.	At the top of the WE LIKE TO SHOP webpage, click the Tech gifts filter.

{{< note >}}
When you interact with the website, Burp Suite Community Edition shows the requests and responses between the browser and the host server. It also shows you the host, method, URL, parameters, and other information for each request.

### Add the payload
Next you can create an attack payload to test if the filter parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection. 
1.	In Burp Suite, go to Proxy > HTTP history.
1.	Select the row where the URL column contains /filter?category=Tech+gifts.
1.	Right-click the above row and select Send to Repeater.
1.	Go to the Repeater tab. On the first line of the request, triple-click the parameter value Tech+gifts to select it.
1.	Replace this selected text with the following: ' UNION SELECT table_name, NULL FROM information_schema.tables
This is your attack payload. If the website is vulnerable to SQL injection, it retrieves the names of tables from the database.

### Step three: Encode the payload using Hackvertor
You cannot send the payload in its current form because it contains invalid characters for a URL query string. Therefore, you must first encode the payload.
1.	Triple-click the payload you added in the previous step.
1.	Right-click the selected payload and select Extensions > Hackvertor > Encode > urlencode. This wraps the text in <@urlencode> tags.
1.	Click Send to send the request.
All the text between the tags is automatically encoded by Hackvertor when the request is sent. 

### Step four: Review 
Finally, you can check the actual request that was sent to the server and the response received in return. To do this, go to the Logger tab, scroll down to the bottom of the list, and select the most recent request.

By looking at the request, you can see that it was sent with the text having been URL-encoded. If you then select this encoded text, the original decoded text you inserted is shown on the Inspector panel on the right-hand side of the screen.

If you now look at the response, you see that it contains a list of table names that have been extracted from the database. You have therefore confirmed that the website is vulnerable to SQL injection. 

You could now continue the attack to further investigate the extent of this vulnerability you have discovered. For example, you could try to extract data from the tables to see if they contain sensitive information. As you used Hackvertor to encode the payload, you can easily edit the original unencoded text and then send a new request, without needing to do any manual decoding or encoding.

      **Welcome to my technical writing portfolio!**
      Here you'll find a selection of writing samples that I hope showcase my writing skills. 
      They include links to real work I've contributed to, demo articles I've created, and a research article I wrote at university. 

      If you'd like to learn more about my experience or get in touch, please check out my LinkedIn profile below.
